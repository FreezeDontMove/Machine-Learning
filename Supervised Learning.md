# Brief Introduction

## Supervised Learning
* what?
    * Giving computers the ability to learn to make decisions from data
    * Without being explicitly programmed
* Examples
  * spam or not
  * cluster wikipedia into different categories
* Supervised learning: Uses labeled data
* Unsupervised learning: Uses unlabeled data

## Unsupervised Learning
* Uncovering hidden patterns from unlabeled data
* Examples:
  * Grouping customers into distinct categories(Clustering)

## Reinforcement Learning
* Software agents interact with an environment
  * Learn how to optimize their behavior
  * Given a system of rewards and punishments
  * Draws inspiration from behavioral psychology
* Applications
  * Economics
  * Genetics
  * Game playing

# Supervised Learning 

* Predictor variables/features and a target variable
* Aim: Predict the target variable, given the predictor variables
  * Classification: Target variable consists of categories
  * Regression: Target variable is continuous
* Use scikit-learn/sklearn/TensorFlow/keras
